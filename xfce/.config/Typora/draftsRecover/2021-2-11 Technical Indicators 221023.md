# Technical Indicators

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

A Lagging momentum indicator with multiple false positives (especially during sideways market), should be used in conjunction with other indicators. Consists of 2 indicators:

1. Momentum indicator :arrow_right: Diff. b/w 2 MA of asset price, e.g. 26 MA - 12 MA
2. Signal :arrow_right: 9 MA  of the asset price

- MACD line cutting the Signal Line **from below** indicates **bullish trend 🐂 📈**
- MACD line cutting the Signal Line **from above** indicates **bearish trend 🐻 📉**

### ATR (Average True Range) & Bollinger Band

Both are complimentary volatility based indicators.
